# Image Encryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation. The script uses the XOR operation to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-encryption-tool.git
   cd image-encryption-tool
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pillow numpy
Usage
To use the script, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Encrypt an Image
sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py encrypt <input_image> <output_image> <key>
<input_image>: Path to the input image you want to encrypt.
<output_image>: Path where the encrypted image will be saved.
<key>: Encryption key (an integer).
Example:

sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py encrypt my_image.png encrypted_image.png 123
Decrypt an Image
sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py decrypt <input_image> <output_image> <key>
<input_image>: Path to the encrypted image.
<output_image>: Path where the decrypted image will be saved.
<key>: Decryption key (must be the same as the encryption key).
Example:

sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py decrypt encrypted_image.png decrypted_image.png 123
Example
Encrypting an Image:

sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py encrypt my_image.png encrypted_image.png 123
This command encrypts my_image.png using the key 123 and saves the encrypted image as encrypted_image.png.

Decrypting an Image:

sh
Copy code
python3 image_encryption.py decrypt encrypted_image.png decrypted_image.png 123
This command decrypts encrypted_image.png using the same key 123 and saves the decrypted image as decrypted_image.png.

Notes
The encryption and decryption keys must be the same for the process to work correctly.
The script performs XOR operation on the pixel values, which is a simple yet effective method for image encryption and decryption.
Ensure the input image is in a format supported by Pillow (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
